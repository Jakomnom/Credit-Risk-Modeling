# Credit-Risk-Modeling

Credit risk modeling serves as the intersection of two critical domains: data science and financial technology (fintech).
Within the banking sector, it stands out as one of the paramount undertakings, gaining heightened significance, particularly in the aftermath
of significant economic downturns like the recent recession. In the contemporary landscape, a distinct offering stands out as the singular
comprehensive credit risk modeling course that utilizes the programming language Python and is readily accessible through online channels.
This course unfolds as a holistic journey, traversing through various stages, each integral to the overall credit risk assessment process.

The example commences with preprocessing, a fundamental step that involves refining and preparing the raw data for analysis.
Subsequently, it delves into the estimation of the probability of default (PD), a pivotal metric that quantifies the likelihood
of a borrower defaulting on their credit obligations. Moving forward, the code addresses the concept of loss given default (LGD),
illuminating the potential loss magnitude in the event of a default.

Continuing on this comprehensive path, the code navigates through exposure at default (EAD) modeling, unraveling the extent of financial exposure
a lender faces when a default scenario materializes. Finally, the code culminates in a vital calculation: the expected loss (EL).
This metric amalgamates the aforementioned elements and presents a comprehensive perspective on the potential loss a financial institution might incur due to credit defaults.

By bridging the realms of data manipulation, statistical modeling, and financial acumen, this credit risk modeling code in Python
is rich with understanding of the multifaceted process involved in assessing and mitigating credit risk.
It recognizes the amalgamation of technology, data-driven insights, and financial expertise as the bedrock of effective risk management
within the dynamic landscape of contemporary finance.

### DATA

The dataset used for this project contains all available data for more than 300,000 consumer loans issued from 2007 to 2015 by Lending Club: a large US peer-to-peer lending company. There are several different versions of this dataset. We have used a version available on kaggle.com. You can find it here.
